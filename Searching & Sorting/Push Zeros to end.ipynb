    "You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N. You have been required to push all the zeros that are present in the array/list to the end of it. Also, make sure to maintain the relative order of the non-zero elements.\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "Change in the input array/list itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to do this in one scan of array only. Don't use extra space.\n",

    "The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.\n",
